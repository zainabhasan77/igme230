    <h1>Reporter Redesign Project</h1>


    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>Reporter is the RIT college news site. Due to the lack of connection between college students and the website, not many students know about Reporter, and not many spend enough time on the site. My goal was to identify the problems and create solutions using research and ideation.
    </p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>User experience and user interface
    </p>


    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <p>This project allowed me to explore different design techniques to solve problems. I learned that understanding the users' needs is at the heart of any successful application. It required that I think outside the box and design a layout that would keep college students interested visually. I look forward to creating more projects that will enable me to combine my passion for research and design.
