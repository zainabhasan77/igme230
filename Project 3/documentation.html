        <b>Audience: </b>My audience will be potential design employers, designers in general, my professors, my classmates. They will be accessing my website when they want to look at my work. Design employers will be looking for my name, my work, resume/about me section, a grid system, clean and modern design, easy to navigate through, and easy to read.

        <b>Design Choices: </b>To begin my design process, I first created a grid. My home page has a grid of two columns and two rows for the photo gallery on desktop, and one column for mobile.
        
        I created a white interface because I wanted to have something clean for the users to navigate through. 
        
        All of my text is black and legible, I use Hind font because it's sans-serif and very clean. For the homepage, I also used Arial because it's one of the most legible fonts. 
        
        I used a blue that's accessible to add color to my portfolio to create a playful, yet clean interface.
        <br> <br>
        
        <b>Sources: </b>I utilized different sites like W3schools and tutorialspoint to learn new code for animation and photo gallery, but I adjusted the code to fit what I needed. 
        <br>
        -Font: Hind (downloaded from Google Fonts)
        <br>
        -All images and work is mine
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Going beyond: </b> I created an animation for my header on my home page which was something I didn't learn in class but had to learn from different websites. I also learned how to create a photo gallery through w3schools. I used my design skills that I have learned in most of my design classes.
