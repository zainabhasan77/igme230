    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My name is Zainab Hasanâ€”I am a junior studying New Media Design at Rochester Institute of Technology. Through my twenty years of living in three different countries, going to different schools, and adapting to different cultures, the one thing that has been consistent is my love for the world, art, and design. I enjoy the process of problem solving and coming up with effective solutions for users. I believe that the person I have become is a collection of the books I've read, the people I've met, and the places I've been. After all, the world is only the stories we tell about it. I am making the best out of my time in college by drinking an absurd amount of iced coffees and staring at screens for long hours. On the side, I collaborate with clients and friends to gain more experience, and learn from motivated people. I high-key would drop anything to travel... if you ever need any travel buddy, you know who to call ðŸ“ž
        <br><br> Please contact me if you would like to know more about me or my design work!
