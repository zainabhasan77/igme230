    <h1>Reporter Redesign Project</h1>


    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>Reporter is the RIT college news site. Due to the lack of connection between college students and the website, not many students know about Reporter, and not many spend enough time on the site. My goal was to identify the problems and create solutions using research and ideation.
    </p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>User experience and user interface
    </p>

    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>1) The cards do not include micro interactions to share or favorite an article. <br>
        2) Type is very settled, this makes it difficult to attract the users eye especially when all cards are consistent in size and color through out the page. <br>
        3) It is not clear what the cards are organized by, especially when on mobile. <br>
        4) Although the website is responsive, there is no Reporter app.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>1) Users tend to share articles on social media often.
        To meet the users needs, I added a share and a bookmark button on all the articles on the home page and the article page. <br>
        2) Users look for specific content and don't like to spend too much time looking for relevant articles.
        Keeping in mind that users use a news site/app to read a specific article, I added recommended articles on the article page to engage the user into browsing.</p>


    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <p>This project allowed me to explore different design techniques to solve problems. I learned that understanding the users' needs is at the heart of any successful application. It required that I think outside the box and design a layout that would keep college students interested visually. I look forward to creating more projects that will enable me to combine my passion for research and design.
