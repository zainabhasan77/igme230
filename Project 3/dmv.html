    <h1>DMV Redesign Project</h1>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>Redesign the DMV online form to create an organized flow for the user. Through research, sketches, and multiple failures, I was able to effectively redesign the file format from print to digital.
    </p>


    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>Research, sketching, wireframing
    </p>

    <h2>Tools</h2>
    <p>For this project, I used Sketch to create visuals, Illustrator for user flows, Indesign for process deck, Invision for prototyping.</p>

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <p>The DMV project was one of my first class projects as a UX/UI student. This project allowed me to learn more about user experience design by doing research and also allowed me to explore different user interface visuals. After time went by, I found myself becoming more knowledgeable, and my passion for learning led me to redo this project while also teaching myself Sketch in the process. I have learned to fail time and time again, but most importantly, I have learned that without failure, there would be nothing to gain. I hope to revisit this project in a few years after gaining more knowledge.
